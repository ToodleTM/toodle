            <p>Making a CSV input file for Toodle is pretty straightforward at the moment.</p>

            <p>The first line should define the columns needed by Toodle to know what to figure from the file. Then each
                line will represent a player entry according to that description. For example : </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <pre>
name, faction
player 1, random
player 2, terran
player 3, zerg
player 4, protoss
player 5, random
player 6, terran
player 7, protoss
player 8, zerg</pre>
                <span class="legend"> "import.csv" example</span>
            </div>
            <p> defines a list of 8 players whose names are on the 1st column and factions on the second</p>

            <p>Only player names are mandatory, so you can do :</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <pre>
name, faction
player 1,
player 2, terran
player 3, zerg
player 4, protoss
player 5,
player 6, terran
player 7, protoss
player 8, zerg</pre>
                <span class="legend"> "import2.csv" example</span>
            </div>
            <p>which will create the same list as above, only with players "player 1" and "player 5" with no faction</p>
            <p>You can also skip the faction column altogether : </p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <pre>
name
player 1
player 2
player 3
player 4
player 5
player 6
player 7
player 8</pre>
                <span class="legend">This is also a valid example</span>
