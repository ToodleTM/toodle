            <h2>Dec. 28th 2015 (v1.4.7)</h2>

            <h3>New features</h3>

            <h4>Slight GUI revamp (again)</h4>
            <p>The interface buttons are now more "menu" like. It seems to be less messy (all buttons are now in one
                clean line that does not move around)</p>
            <p>Related functions have been regrouped under the same menus. For example, links to get to the public or embed pages are now regrouped under the "related pages" menu.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/12282015/00_regrouped_menus.png"/>
                <span class="legend">Regrouped functions look & feel.</span>
            </div>
            <h4>"Real" new feature : The Cup Management</h4>
            <p>Cup Management allows you to create follow-up tournaments once a tournament you've run has ended (i.e:
                winners are known). The cup system is embedded into the app and does not require you to choose a
                particular tournament at the beginning.</p>
            <p>The features : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Once a tournament has ended, you can choose to follow it up with another tournament (the most
                    straightforward example would be to inject winners from group stages into a bracket).
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/whatsnew/12282015/01_new_button.png"/>
                        <span class="legend">The button to create follow-up tournaments will appear on the right of the menu bar once a tournament has ended.</span>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>If you choose to do so, Toodle will ask you for details about the new tournament (name, start date,
                    description ... as it would when creating a normal tournament)
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/whatsnew/12282015/02_form.png"/>
                        <span class="legend">The form is like the standard one. Just input a title, select your engine, and you're good to go =)</span>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Depending on the number of winners and the nature of the follow-up tournament, you'll be able to
                    start right away if you do so desire, but you'll also have all the normal options (as rearranging
                    players in the follow up tournament). If it's not possible to start right away, you'll still be
                    taken to the admin page of the follow-up tournament and asked to fix what needs to be fixed before
                    starting.
                </li>
                <li>Once a follow-up tournament has started, the initial tournament is locked (cannot edit it in any way
                    that'd change the winners anymore)
                </li>
                <li>In the follow-up tournament page, there is a button that allows you to display the previous
                    tournament (aka: parent tournament) and its parent's parent, and so on until you move all the way up
                    to the initial tournament.
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/whatsnew/12282015/05_button_off.png"/>
                        <span class="legend">Button to show parent tournaments is always shown at the bottom</span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/whatsnew/12282015/05_button_on.png"/>
                        <span class="legend">Once clicked, the parent tournament is displayed. If that parent tournament also has a parent, the button stays visible and allows you to display the parent's parent.</span>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>There is no fixed limit on how many tournaments can be chained this way</li>
                <li>On each tournament in a cup, you have menus to help you navigate between tournaments.
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="images/whatsnew/12282015/07_nav_menus.png"/>
                        <span class="legend">Menus allow to access nearest parent / son tournament. Similar menus are displayed in the public page (just not showing admin links).</span>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>This was made to be able to mix tournaments of any engines (existing, of course, but also & kinda
                    more importantly, upcoming). We don't want any limitations put on this so that a complete tournament
                    going through different phases will be possible as long as tournament engines individually support
                    what you're shooting for.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a consequence, the "export winners" button once a tournament has finished has disappeared (for now, at
                least).</p>

            <h2>Sept. 20th 2015 (v1.2.3)</h2>
            <p>Not much to say about this version, some tweaks and fixes for the most part, plus one interesting feature
                : embedding.</p>
            <p>Embedding is a feature that allows you to link to a tournament bracket from another site using iframes.
                The page to include is different from admin / play pages in a way that only the core information is
                available (current tournament standings, read-only).</p>

            <h2>August 24th 2015(v1.2.1)</h2>

            <p>This release represents a major GUI overhaul. This release is meant to :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simplify even more tournament creation</li>
                <li>Add a few missing features and improvements</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>On the GUI overhaul side : </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating a tournament immediately takes you to the essential part : registering the players and
                    defining the type of tournament you want
                </li>
                <li>Admin and "regular player" pages were changed so that all tournament fine tuning is hidden and the
                    first thing you see is your bracket. If you want to access to all fine tuning settings, just click
                    the main title and the menu will deploy.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>On the features side : </h3>

            <p> This release has seen the addition of various features that should be useful :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Both "Single Elimination Bracket" and "Simple GSL Groups" engines now support :
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Player forfeits
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Continuous reporting
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Pre-arrangement of players before tournament starts (by clicking the spots you want to swap)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Various noticeable changes</h3>
            <h4>What disappeared</h4>

            <p>The "lock tournament" feature is no more, it might be back someday, you never know ;)</p>
            <h4>What appeared</h4>

            <p>No more clicking validation buttons all the time, each action auto-saves what you just did.</p>

            <p>Adding multiple players one by one always refocuses the nickname input field (provided addition went
                well)</p>

            <h3>More in detail :</h3>
            <h4>Registration screen</h4>

            <p>It now integrates not only the tournament name, but you can also specify the description or the start
                date here.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/screen1.png"/>
                <span class="legend">it takes you directly to the next step once you validate</span>
            </div>
            <h4>Player registration / engine choice</h4>

            <p>This is a new step, it allows you to configure the essentials (register some players, choose the engine,
                get the tournament started)</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/screen2.png"/>
                <span class="legend">The two more important decisions for your tournament</span>
            </div>
            <p>You can then start the tournament right away, choose to leave additional players who'd want to register
                time to do so by using the "Configure" option when starting, or choose to move players around w/ the
                preconfiguration option.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/screen2-configure.png"/>
                <span class="legend">The middle option creates the tournament but does not start it right away</span>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/screen2-prearrange.png"/>
                <span class="legend">Each compatible engine will show a submenu for the start button, allowing you to pre-arrange players</span>
            </div>
            <h4>Pre-arrangement / players move around</h4>

            <p>The "let me configure players" option, when it is available, takes you to a page that show you the
                tournament as it is arranged by default, given the players registered and the order they were registered
                in, and lets you move players around by clicking on a slot and then on another.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/screen3-bracket.png"/>
                <span class="legend">Before swapping players around</span>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/screen3-bracket-selected.png"/>
                <span class="legend">Echo_pwner is selected</span>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/screen3-bracket-done.png"/>
                <span class="legend">After clicking on Echo_pwner and Corvo, the 2 players are swapped, clicking twice on the same player deselects him</span>
            </div>
            <h4>Bracket / Groups revamp</h4>

            <p>We've changed the icons used to report / unreport games (no more ugly circles, "<span
                    class="glyphicon glyphicon-edit"></span>" and "<span
                    class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash"></span>" instead). We also changed several
                colours so that the bracket / group displays should not burn through people's retinas as much.</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/newicons-bracket.png"/>
                <span class="legend">New icons for the bracket</span>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/newicons-groups.png"/>
                <span class="legend">New icons for groups</span>
            </div>
            <h4>Forfeits</h4>

            <p>The match reporting dialog now allows for forfeits to be reported, you can forfeit a player by clicking
                on the little "<span
                        class="glyphicon glyphicon-ban-circle"></span>" logo in the field for his score. The engines
                will then count this as a win for the other player and save the scores for that match</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/forfeit.png"/>
                <span class="legend">Forfeit crosses the forfeit player name out and locks all inputs</span>
            </div>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/forfeit-display.png"/>
                <span class="legend">Forfeits are displayed differently from victories so you can keep track at a glance</span>
            </div>
            <h4>Continuous reporting</h4>

            <p>The reporting feature now allows to save a partial score. When a score is valid to report a victory
                (scores are different).</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/continuous.png"/>
                <span class="legend">A checkbox pops up for the reporter to select if the score reported is final or
                not</span>
            </div>
            <h4>Admin page</h4>

            <p>Most fine tuning tools are now hidden in a menu, so that the first thing you see in the admin page is the
                actual bracket when a tournament has started</p>

            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/screen4-main-deployed.png"/>
                <span class="legend">Clicking on the tournament name, or the caret next to it, will deploy this menu, clicking again will hide it.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/whatsnew/08302015/screen4-main-players.png"/>
                <span class="legend">The second tab show player management features.</span>
            </div>
            <p>A roughly equivalent menu (except not allowing tournament modificationss, just displaying infos and
                allowing
                players to register) exists for the tournament's public page</p>
        </div>
